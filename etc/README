This is my tiny set of COVID-19 analysis scripts.

They are intended for visualizing the history of Covid-19.  No models are
created; no projections made.

S till it is useful to look at the raw data and their daily diffs as this can
suggest where a region of interest is on the disease progression curve.

The data is on github at

	https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19 

New data for each day is published shortly at 23:59:59Z.  I generally
refresh at about 00:10Z.

To play with the data you will need to clone the repo into a suitable
directory.

	git clone 'https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19'
u
will put the repo into a directory COVID-19 in your current working
directory.  You can move the repo or delete it and re-clone if you
think it should be in another place

The tarball will create directory covid-19-analysis in the directory
where you extract it:

	cd 'the right place"
	tar xvzf cv19.tgz

If it worked:

	cd covid-19-analysis
	ls -F

	cv.all.tsv scripts/    us.all.tsv

	ls -l scripts
	total 56
	-rwxr-xr-x  1 tom  staff  1303 Apr  1 19:04 collect_regions.sh
	-rw-r--r--  1 tom  staff   929 Mar 25 20:25 fmt.py
	-rwxr-xr-x  1 tom  staff  1251 Mar 27 09:41 fmt_cv_data.sh
	-rwxr-xr-x  1 tom  staff  1071 Apr  5 11:02 get_latest_cv_data.sh

	-rw-r--r--  1 tom  staff  1254 Mar 22 20:15 plotCVDataMain.R

The 2 tsv files contain the entire dataset and the dataset for the US.
These files do NOT contiain a header which gets in the way of simple
selecting.  And it's easy to add in R

The format is

	date	region	country	lat	long	confirmed	deaths	recovered

Notes:
	1. Date is YYYY-MM-DD
	2. Some but not all countries provide data at some regional level, eg
	   Isle of Man<tab>United Kingdom
	3. If no region was present in the original data, I've used a dot "."
	   as a place holder rather than "", so England, Scotland and Wales 
	   would be .<tab>United Kingdom

Once you've set up the repo, you will need to edit the file

	scripts/get_latest_cv_data.sh

and change the symbol CV_DATA to point to your COVID-19 repo. Once this is
done return to the parent of the script directory and get the data

	cd ../
	rm *.tsv
	./scripts/get_latest_cv_data.sh > cv.all.tsv

You can select the US data with this command

	grep US cv.all.tsv > us.all.csv

To view it, start R

R

dataset <- 'us'
fname <- 'us.all.tsv'
source('./scripts/plotCVData.R')

This will show 5 graphs:

	confirmed (black)
	deaths (red)
	recovered (green)
	conf_diff (orange)	-- day to day increase
	deaths/confirmed (blue)	

It turns out that confirmed is a lousy number as testing keeps increaing, so

source('./scripts/plotCVData2.R')

will show 3 graphs:

	deaths (red)
	death_diff (orange)
	deaths/confirmed (blue)

which is much better, although this doens't show if a death was _DUE TO_ Covid-19
or that Covid-19 _WAS PRESENT_ at the time of death.  This matters a lot, but I
don't have access that data.

In the event you get this working, you'll see that the US deaths daily diffs plot
may be approaching linear which means that we're now parabolic as opposed to 
exponential.

Aside: disease phases:

	exp growth -> increasing -> peak -> decreasing -> exp decay

Looks like a normal curve.

Aside: exponential growth:

	It always ends b/c resources can't grow faster than n^3, which is 
	<< e^n
